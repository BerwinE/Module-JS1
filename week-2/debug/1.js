// Predict and explain first...

console.log(`The sum of 10 and 32 is ${sum(10, 32)}`);
//the sum of 10 and 32 will return undefined. there is a sum function that adds a and b but does not return the sum because it doesnot actually sum them as return prevents the sum to reach a and b

//the return statement is empty and followed by any value
